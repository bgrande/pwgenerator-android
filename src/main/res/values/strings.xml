It is provided with no warranties.\n\nThe app is compatible with as well as based on https://getvau.lt. Except on some pages where the allowed symbols are restricted and being injected by configuration.\n\nThe app provides you with a password generator which generates a password out of a salt (servicename) and your passphrase.\nBy combining these values you can always recover your password for a specific service or account without using the same password over and over again.\n\nYou can leave the domain field empty. If you are using domain based servicenames with a specific pattern it might be useful to use the domain field.
